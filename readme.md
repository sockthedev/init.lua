# sockthedev's Neovim configuration

Honestly, Neovim is the coolest shizzle I've played with for a long time. I can't believe how hard I've been bitten by this bug. This repository is my personal configuration for it.

To install;

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sockthedev/init.lua
cd init.lua
./install
```
