# sockthedev's Neovim configuration

What a vibe this stuff is! Honestly, Neovim is the coolest shizzle I've played
with for a long time. I can't believe how hard I've been bitten by this bug.

To install;

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sockthedev/init.lua
cd init.lua
./install
```

My config is mostly a process of copying configuration from the following 
dotfiles shared by developers more awesome than I am at Neovim;
